# Cafe-Dataset-Clean-And-EDA
This project explores a cafeâ€™s sales dataset through data cleaning in SQL and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using both SQL and Python. The goal was to transform messy transactional data into a clean, analysis-ready format and then uncover insights about item popularity, customer behavior, and revenue trends.
